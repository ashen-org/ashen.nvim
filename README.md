# Ashen

Coding is already hard on the brain, so it should at least be easy on the eyes. Ashen is a warm, muted colorscheme that evokes the feeling of embers sizzling out in an old fire pit. It features red & orange tones, plenty of grayscale, and hints of teal.

## Features

- Warm, cozy palette that's easy on the eyes.
- Clear differentiation of errors and warnings.
- Supports a number of [plugins](#plugins).
- Fast load time.
- Actively developed.

## Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/):

```lua
{
  "ficcdaf/ashen.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  -- configuration is optional!
  opts = {
    -- your settings here
  },
}
```

You can load Ashen anywhere in your Neovim configuration:

```lua
vim.cmd("colorscheme ashen")
-- You may call the load function as well
require("ashen").load()
```

If you're using [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/), I recommend the following:

```lua
return {
  { "ficcdaf/ashen.nvim" },
  -- Configure LazyVim to load Ashen
  {
    "LazyVim/LazyVim",
    opts = {
      colorscheme = "ashen",
    },
  }
}
```

## Plugins

> [!WARNING]
> The following may be incomplete! Please check `lua/ashen/plugins` for an up-to-date list of supported plugins. I will endeavour to update this README frequently.

Many plugins are already "supported" because they use standard Neovim highlight groups. However, some plugins require bespoke support. Additionally, some plugins may require extra setup to look good with Ashen. Please see [Configuration](#configuration) for more details.

Ashen explicitly supports the following plugins:

- blink.cmp
- nvim-cmp
- flash.nvim
- lualine
- mini.icons
- trailblazer.nvim
- obsidian.nvim
- oil.nvim
- render-markdown.nvim
- telescope.nvim
- minimap.vim

## Configuration

> [!WARNING] If you choose to set any options, please not that `setup` _only_ sets up
> the configuration and does **not** load the theme! You must call `colorscheme ashen`
> or `require("ashen").load()` _after_ `setup`!

You can pass an options table to the `setup` function to configure Ashen, the same you would any other plugin. If you use `lazy.nvim`, you can set options as shown in [installation](#installation)!

```Lua
require("ashen").setup({
  -- your settings here
})
-- theme must be loaded *after* setup!
vim.cmd("colorscheme ashen")
```

The following default settings are provided. Any settings not self-explanatory will be expanded on below. Any provided settings will be merged with the defaults.

```Lua
{
  -- override palette, see below
  ---@type Palette
  ---@field [ColorName] HexCode
  colors = {},
  -- force clear other highlights
  -- even if no other theme is set
  -- (useful for debugging)
  force_hi_clear = false,
  -- enable termguicolors on load (recommended)
  termguicolors = true,
}
```

### Palette Override

You can override any color in Ashen's palette, or set new colors entirely. The `colors` setting accepts a table of `ColorName = HexCode` pairs, where they are both strings, with `ColorName` corresponding to an Ashen color, and `HexCode` being a `#` prefixed hexadecimal color code. For an list of available color names, please see [colors.lua](./lua/ashen/colors.lua).

Please see the following example:

```Lua
{
  colors = {
    background = "#000000",
    red_ember = "##933737"
  },
}
```

> [!TIP] Made a palette you're proud of? It could become Ashen's next "theme variant" -- don't be afraid to open a feature request for it!

### Highlight Override

_Not yet implemented, but coming soon to an Ashen installation near you!_

## Plugin Configuration

### Lualine

Ashen comes with a preconfigured Lualine theme that includes a word counter for Markdown, Text, and Latex files. Optionally, [noice.nvim](https://github.com/folke/noice.nvim) is used to indicate Macro recording status, and [pomo.nvim](https://github.com/epwalsh/pomo.nvim) is supported. The following is an example of how to configure Lualine to use Ashen:

```lua
return {
  "nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim",
  -- ensure Ashen is loaded first
  dependencies = {
    "ficcdaf/ashen.nvim",
  },
  opts = function()
    local ashen = require("ashen.plugins.lualine").lualine_opts
    -- you can set any other options
    -- expected by lualine, since this
    -- table will be passed directly to `setup`
    ashen.extensions = { "lazy", "fzf" }
    return ashen
  end,
}
```

> I am working on improving the word counter and releasing it as a separate plugin. When that happens, Ashen will be updated to support it out of the box.

### Trailblazer.nvim

Trailblazer tends to overwrite the highlight groups set by Ashen. Therefore, you may need to invoke Ashen's Trailblazer setup immediately _after_ loading Trailblazer. Please see the following example:

```lua
return {
  "LeonHeidelbach/trailblazer.nvim",
  event = "UIEnter",
  -- ensure Ashen is loaded first
  dependencies = {
    "ficcdaf/ashen.nvim",
  },
  config = function()
    require("trailblazer").setup({
      -- your Trailblazer setup here
    })
    -- This ensures Ashen's HL groups are set up
    -- AFTER Trailblazer sets its own.
    require("ashen.plugins").setup("trailblazer")
  end,
}
```

### Render-markdown.nvim

Ashen will support `render-markdown` OOTB with no additional configuration. You may optionally consider including the following icons in your setup. Note they may not render properly in all browsers.

```lua
-- as part of render-markdown.nvim setup
opts = {
  bullet = {
    -- cleaner bullet points
    icons = { "•", "∙" },
  },
  heading = {
    -- Icons that say H1, H2, etc.
    icons = { "󰉫 ", "󰉬 ", "󰉭 ", "󰉮 ", "󰉯 ", "󰉰 " },
  },

}
```

### Nvim-colorizer

The following code snippet configures `nvim-colorizer` to use Ashen's palette when previewing certain named colors:

```Lua
return {
  "catgoose/nvim-colorizer.lua",
  event = "BufReadPre",
  dependencies = {
    "ficcdaf/ashen.nvim",
  },
  opts = {
    user_default_options = {
      names = true,
      names_custom = function()
        return require("ashen.colors")
      end,
    },
  },
}
```

## Extras
