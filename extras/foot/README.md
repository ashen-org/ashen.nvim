The recommended way to install the theme is to use foot's `include` directive.
Clone this repository and place the following into your `foot.ini` file:

```ini
# Must be an absolute path.
include=~/dev/plugins/ashen.nvim/extras/foot/ashen.ini
```

Alternatively, you may copy the contents of `ashen.ini` into you `foot.ini`
file.
